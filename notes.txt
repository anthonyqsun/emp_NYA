lab02 -- BinSearch vs LinSearch
2021-12-16
Time Spent: 2.3 hrs

DISCOS:
0. print statements take much longer to execute than normal arithmetic procedures.
1. LinSearch is faster than BinSearch up to a certain threshold
2. Dividing by the length of the sorted collection to find the average time can be problematic because if the length is too large, the time will round to zero.

QCC:
0. When is it better to use LinSearch than BinSearch?
1. Should we use iterative BinSearch or recursive BinSearch? Both?

GALLERY TOUR:
0. Team Brains suggested that we should make the lengths of the arrays that we are testing on smaller and that we should increase the amount of times that we run through each so that there is less variation between our results.
1. People tested binary search exclusively because 0 or 1 milliseconds for each binary search.
