Plan:
0. Have multiple arrays of varying lengths. 
1. Have a randomly generated target
2. For each array, use LinSearch() and BinSearch() to find the target and record the time it took to do so.
3. Repeat the previous step up to 20 times and find the average time it takes to find the target for each search method.
4. Have a ratio of average LinSearch() time to average BinSearch() time for each array.
