Plan:
0. Have multiple Comparable arrays of varying lengths: 1-20, 100, 500, 1000, 10000, 50000. Eventually, we plan to test with a list of 1000000 items once everything works.
1. Have a few randomly generated targets, a target outside the array, and a target less than floor(log(n)/log(2))+1 to test cases where LinSearch might outperform BinSearch.
2. For each array, use LinSearch() and BinSearch() to find the target and record the time it took to do so.
3. Repeat the previous step up to 1000 times and find the average time it takes to find the target for each search method.
4. Print the ratio of average LinSearch() time to average BinSearch() time for each array.
