Insights from other groups:
- Four: iterative/recursive BinSearch; timestamp is a long type

We found that the mills difference had a slight error each time
We found that sometimes, there was a pause after printing the time difference before the program completes

We ran into an error with finding the average time for LinSearch and BinSearch. Anthony decided to remove this and just use the cumulative time instead.
We decided to implement a feature that lets the user know when each iteration is complete. This helps us get a better sense of how long the program will take to run.
Nakib updated plan.txt, log.txt

Anthony did the gallery tour
Nakib presented the findings to the other groups
We found one of our conclusions to be inaccurate. For an array with a length of 2 million, we said BinSearch would be around 600 times faster but that was a very rare case. After more trials, we found BinSearch to be around 1600 times faster than LinSearch.
Updated notes.txt (added GALLERY section)
