We found that the mills difference had a slight error each time
We found that sometimes, there was a pause after printing the time difference before the program completes

We ran into an error with finding the average time for LinSearch and BinSearch. Anthony decided to remove this and just use the cumulative time instead.
We decided to implement a feature that lets the user know when each iteration is complete. This helps us get a better sense of how long the program will take to run.
Nakib updated plan.txt, log.txt
